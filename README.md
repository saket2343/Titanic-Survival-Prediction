# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
This project is a data science and machine learning analysis on the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to predict the survival of passengers based on features like gender, age, class, fare, and family relationships.
This notebook applies multiple classification algorithms including Logistic Regression and Random Forest to predict passenger survival. 
It involves:
  Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
  Feature Engineering (e.g., encoding categorical variables, handling missing values)
  Model Building and Comparison
  Cross-validation and Hyperparameter Tuning
  Final Evaluation and Insights
